Create a function called "timeAdder" that can add two time values together. 

The function should accept 4 parameters:
value1, label1, value2, label2

- value1 and value2 should accept positive integers  

- label1 and label2 should accept any of the following strings: "seconds", "minutes", "hours", "days", "second", "minute", "hour", "day"

==> The function must accept any possible combination of inputs 
==> If the inputs are valid, it should return an array with 2 variables inside of it: value3, and  label3. ( Rather than returning an arbitrary label for label3, return the largest label that can be used with an integer value )
==> If the inputs are invalid or impossible, it should return false.
